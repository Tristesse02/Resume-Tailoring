Then I use a Facebook OPT-1.3b model to find the next highest chance occuring word so that it would act as the word suggestion based on the context is what we were saying. And those suggested word will be display in terms of word cloud with its size correspond to the weight. Later, all of the transcribe is saved under S3 storage",
