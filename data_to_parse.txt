			Description: Noticing that many people, especially international students struggle in finding the word or phrase to describe a situation during interview, I created a tools that suggest word in real time. All we have to do is that speaking into the mic, the live transcribe by Amazon will help transcribe those voice data and send back to us. Then I use a Facebook OPT-1.3b model to find the next highest chance occuring word so that it would act as the word suggestion based on the context is what we were saying. And those suggested word will be display in terms of word cloud with its size correspond to the weight. Later, all of the transcribe is saved under S3 storage
